6. Joins – Combine data from multiple tables based on a common field.


7. Dashboard/Worksheet/Story Use – Worksheet builds views, Dashboard combines them, Story presents insights in sequence.


8. Categorical/Numerical Columns – Categorical are dimensions (discrete), numerical are measures (continuous).


9. Dimension/Measure – Dimensions are qualitative fields, measures are quantitative fields.


10. Visualization Charts Use – Used to represent data visually (bar, line, map, etc.) for insights.


11. Dashboard Show Me Use – Suggests suitable charts based on selected fields.


12. Data Pane – Contains fields (dimensions/measures) available for visualization.


13. Analytics Pane – Provides features like trendlines, forecasts, reference lines, etc.


14. Marks Card – Controls how data is displayed using color, size, shape, label, tooltip, etc.


15. Color/Text/Tooltip/Size/Detail Use – Enhance data visualization by encoding information into marks.


16. Filters Use – Limit the data shown in a view.


17. Column Shelf/Row Shelf Use – Place fields to define chart structure (X and Y axis).


18. Create Alias/Hierarchy/Calculated Field – Aliases rename values, hierarchies group fields, calculated fields create new metrics.


19. Aggregate Functions Use – Summarize data (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.).


20. Text Functions/Logical Functions – Text functions manipulate strings, logical functions evaluate conditions (IF, CASE).


21. What are Maps – Visual representations of data with geographical context.
